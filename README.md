Overview
This project focuses on scraping shark attack data from online sources to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. We have used various data cleaning methods to extract data specifically with a focus on shark attacks in Florida. The data includes information on the activity type, type of species and other relevant details. The primary objective of this analysis is to promote bussiness ideas about a device that helps divers to send an push notification for help and detect the most probable locations for shark-watching activities.
